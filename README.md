## My AWS Cloud Journey

I recently earned my **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** credential, marking the beginning of my transition into the cloud space from a non-tech background.  
This certification gave me a strong foundation in AWS services, global infrastructure, pricing models, and how cloud technology helps businesses solve real-world challenges.

### Next Steps:
-  Preparing for **AWS Solutions Architect Associate** certification  
-  Building **hands-on cloud projects** using AWS Free Tier  
-  Exploring use cases in web hosting, automation, and secure architecture  

The cloud isn’t just for engineers—it’s for curious minds ready to grow, build, and make an impact.
